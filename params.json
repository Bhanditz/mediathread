{"name":"Mediathread","body":"Mediathread is CCNMTL's innovative, open-source platform for exploration, analysis, and organization of web-based multimedia content. Mediathread connects to a variety of image and video collections (such as YouTube, Flickr, library databases, and course libraries), enabling users to lift items out of these collections and into an analysis environment. In Mediathread, items can then be clipped, annotated, organized, and embedded into essays and other written analysis.\r\n\r\nWork in Mediathread can be shared with classmates or larger audiences, requiring students to formalize thinking, clarify interpretations, and improve arguments with evidence. A customized home page helps students track work being done by their classmates on shared items and projects. Instructors may also publish announcements, assignments, and model projects to the home page. \r\n\r\n===========================================================\r\nMediathread\r\n===========================================================\r\n\r\nMediathread is a Django site for multimedia annotations facilitating\r\ncollaboration on video and image analysis.
